**[INTRO: Upbeat music fades in]**

**HOST:** (enthusiastically) Hey there, friends! Have you ever wondered if you could *really* tell if someone is lying? What if I told you there's a *simple test* that reveals the truth? [PAUSE]

**[CUT TO: HOST sitting at a table with props]**

**HOST:** Picture this: You're having a casual conversation with a friend. Suddenly, they share a story that seems... just a bit off. [PAUSE] You feel that gut instinct, right? 

Well, here’s the simple test. [PAUSE] Ask them to elaborate on a specific detail. If they get flustered or change their story—BAM! [EMPHASIS] You might just have caught a fibber in action. 

But why does this work? [PAUSE] It’s all about our brain’s ability to keep track of truths versus lies. When pressed, the truth flows, while lies often stumble. 

So next time you’re in doubt, remember this *simple test*! [PAUSE]
