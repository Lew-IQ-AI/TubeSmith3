The AI engineer's work focused on improving TubeSMith, an AI YouTube Video Generator. The journey was characterized by persistent debugging of core functionalities, notably video assembly and frontend-backend synchronization. Initial challenges involved resolving script generation timeouts, which led to significant backend (OpenAI client, prompt optimization, timeout handling) and frontend (AbortController, state management) enhancements. A major UI overhaul to match the VideoForge style was completed.

The most complex and recurring issue was the video assembly, frequently failing or getting stuck at 80%. This involved:
1.  **FFmpeg Installation & Pathing:** Initially missing, then recurring file not found errors due to incorrect subprocess paths (, ) and problematic MoviePy imports.
2.  **ARM64 Performance:** Diagnosed by  as the cause of extreme slowness, requiring significant timeout increases and command optimization.
3.  **Frontend State Persistence:** Old error messages and status updates were cached in the frontend and backend (global dictionary, persistent JSON files), leading to confusion despite backend success. This required rigorous state clearing.
4.  **Download System:** Initial issues with wrong base URLs and later with the video player in the modal trying to play non-existent videos.
5.  **Pexels Integration:** Stock videos were fetched but not used in final video, then re-enabled, but still faced FFmpeg concat issues with video-only clips. This was temporarily disabled.
6.  **Content Quality:** Script stage directions and poor DALL-E 3 thumbnails (misspelled text) were addressed by prompt engineering.

The overall approach was iterative, employing  for deep root cause analysis on critical blockers. The latest fixes involved re-enabling Pexels but immediately encountering a new FFmpeg uninstallation issue, indicating instability in the video processing environment.

<product_requirements>
The goal is to enhance TubeSMith, an AI YouTube Video Generator.
**Core Features (Existing):**
-   AI Script Generation (OpenAI GPT-4/gpt-4o-mini)
-   AI Voice-over (ElevenLabs)
-   AI Thumbnail Creation (DALL-E 3)
-   Stock Video Search (Pexels API)
-   YouTube SEO Optimization
-   File Download System

**User-Requested Enhancements & Fixes Implemented/Attempted:**
1.  **Script Generation Reliability:** Fix timeouts for 10-minute videos via backend/frontend optimizations.
2.  **UI Redesign:** Adopt VideoForge style (video length dropdown, dynamic button text, organized progress cards, compact layout, no scrolling).
3.  **Header Simplification:** Craft viral... to 1-Click Content Creation.
4.  **Content Preview/Download:** Remove Quick Downloads, implement clickable thumbnail for video preview modal (with actual MP4 playback).
5.  **Full MP4 Video Assembly:** Combine audio, visuals, and timing into a final MP4 video using FFmpeg.
6.  **Thumbnail Quality:** Address misspelled words and poor quality from DALL-E 3.
7.  **Script Quality:** Remove stage directions (e.g., setup, fade in) from AI-generated scripts.
8.  **Pexels Integration:** Ensure stock video clips are *actually used* in the final video, not just static thumbnails.
9.  **Frontend UI Clean-up:** Remove ElevenLabs and DALL-E 3 labels, and temporary test download buttons.

<key_technical_concepts>
-   **Full-Stack Development:** React (frontend), FastAPI (backend), MongoDB (database).
-   **AI/LLM Integrations:** OpenAI (GPT-4/gpt-4o-mini, DALL-E 3), ElevenLabs, Pexels API.
-   **Video Processing:** FFmpeg (direct calls for assembly), FFprobe (for media info).
-   **Asynchronous Operations:** Background tasks (FastAPI ).
-   **State Management:** React  for UI; global dictionaries and persistent JSON for backend status.
-   **Environment Variables:** Secure configuration ( files, ).
-   **Error Handling:** Frontend , backend timeouts, robust exception handling.
-   **Service Control:** Supervisor for managing  and  services.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture:



-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Centralizes backend API logic, AI integrations, file operations, and video processing.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -   OpenAI client updated (timeout, ), script prompt refined (to exclude stage directions), DALL-E prompt for thumbnails improved (no text).
        -    endpoint implemented/refactored for background video processing.
        -    for polling.
        -   Integrated direct FFmpeg/FFprobe calls (absolute paths , ).
        -   Implemented robust error handling, status recovery for video assembly (fixed  status recovery).
        -   Temporarily removed  and  Python library imports due to conflicts.
        -    global dictionary cleared on startup to prevent stale states.
        -   Video assembly logic modified multiple times: initially static thumbnail, then attempted Pexels integration (downloading clips, concat filter fixes for absolute paths, handling video-only clips), then *reverted* to static thumbnail only, then *re-enabled* Pexels, encountering FFmpeg uninstallation.

-   ****:
    -   **Importance**: Main UI component, handling user interactions, state, and API calls.
    -   **Changes Made**:
        -    for fetch timeouts, refined state (, , ).
        -   Major UI overhaul for VideoForge style: length dropdown, dynamic buttons, compact layout, removal of Quick Downloads.
        -   Implemented clickable content cards and a video preview modal for MP4 playback.
        -   Added download functionality for script, voiceover, thumbnail, and final video (via  for reliability).
        -   Introduced debug Force Status Refresh and Download Test Video buttons (later removed).
        -   Fixed video player in modal to use correct video ID.
        -   Extensive state clearing added (, ) to combat persistent frontend errors.
        -   UI text changes: Voice to Voice Over, removed ElevenLabs and DALL-E 3.
</code_architecture>

<pending_tasks>
-   Fully re-enable and stabilize dynamic video creation using Pexels stock footage. The feature was re-enabled but immediately failed due to FFmpeg being uninstalled again.
-   Ensure FFmpeg persists across service restarts or implement a robust check/install at startup.
</pending_tasks>

<current_work>
The immediate problem is that the TubeSMith application, after recent changes to re-enable dynamic video generation using Pexels, is failing because **FFmpeg is reported as not found ()**. This occurred immediately after restarting the backend service.

Previously, the AI engineer had:
1.  Successfully fixed the issue of static thumbnail videos not playing and buttons not working (download buttons now work, modal video plays the static thumbnail+voiceover).
2.  Addressed user feedback to make thumbnails better (no text, improved prompt) and scripts cleaner (no stage directions).
3.  Re-enabled the Pexels stock video integration (after temporarily disabling it due to earlier failures and focusing on stable basic video creation). This involved re-activating the logic to download clips, create , and assemble them using FFmpeg's concat filter. This feature was previously problematic due to FFmpeg concat issues (e.g., relative paths in , handling video-only clips, and ARM64 performance).

The current situation is that the  code has the logic to fetch and assemble Pexels videos, but the core dependency (FFmpeg) is missing from the environment, leading to immediate video assembly failures. The last action taken was to reinstall FFmpeg and attempt another video generation.

<optional_next_step>
Re-verify FFmpeg installation, then attempt a new video generation to confirm stock footage integration.
